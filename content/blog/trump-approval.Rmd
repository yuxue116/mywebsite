## Trump's Average Net Approval Rate

We calculated the average net approval rate for each week that Trump has been in office. 

```{r, cache=TRUE}

#Keeping only voters as the subgroup 
approval_polllist_dates <-approval_polllist_dates %>% filter(subgroup == "Voters")

#Adding net rate to the data set "approval_polllist_dates"
approval_polllist_dates <- approval_polllist_dates %>% mutate(net_rate = (approve-disapprove)/(approve+disapprove)*100) %>%
  filter(!is.na(net_rate))

#Calculating average net rate on a weekly basis
Weekly_rating <- approval_polllist_dates %>% 
  group_by(year,week_count) %>% 
  summarise(average_weekly_netrate = mean(net_rate),SD = sd(net_rate), SE = SD/sqrt(length(net_rate)), DF = length(net_rate)-1) %>%
  filter(!is.na(SD)) 
  #filter(!is.na(SE)) %>% 
  #filter(!is.na(DF)) %>%
  #filter(!is.na(CI.upper)) %>% 
  #filter(!is.na(CI.lower)) 

#Defining confidence intervals
Weekly_rating <- Weekly_rating %>% mutate(CI.upper = average_weekly_netrate+qt(.975,DF)*SE, CI.lower = average_weekly_netrate-qt(.975,DF)*SE)

#Plotting the data

## Comparing Trumps Confidence Intervals

What's going on? 

The 95% confidence interval for week 15 (-7.59, -9.09) is relatively narrower than the interval for week 34 (-9.29, -13.16) implying tighter clustering of data near the mean, and lesser dispersion. This translates to a higher proportion of people maintaining their approval rating in week 15, compared to week 34 where the mean approval ratings went further down. One noticeable difference between the two weeks in reference is that the confidence intervals for the approval ratings don't overlap, and with both the weeks having negative ratings, further downside movement with no overlap to the CI in week 15 doesn't bode well as re-elections near. 

A cause of this variance could be the proximity of re-election date, with more promising candidates (Like Joe Biden) proposing election manifestos contrasting Trump's policies on response to COVID, racial discrimination and unemployment.
