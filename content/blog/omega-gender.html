<h1>Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination</h1>
<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>The objective of this analysis is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<h2>Relationship Salary - Gender</h2>
<p>The data frame <code>omega</code> contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. In order to find out the relationship between salary and gender in this group, we perform four different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidence intervals</li>
<li>Hypothesis testing</li>
<li>Correlation analysis</li>
<li>Regression</li>
</ul>
<p>For confidence intervals analyse, we create and print a dataframe where, for each gender,show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Summary Statistics of salary by gender

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size,

# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error,and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval 
  mutate(t_critical=qt(0.975,sample_size-1),
            SE=SD/sqrt(sample_size),

There is no overlap between the 95% confidence intervals for the average salary of the two sexes, which implies that in this group, maleâ€™s mean salary is higher than that of female.</p>
<p>Our teem also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money.</p>
<p>First, we run the hypothesis testing using <code>t.test()</code> and the code is shown as below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary~gender,data=omega)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  salary by gender
## t = -4, df = 48, p-value = 2e-04
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -12973  -4420
## sample estimates:
## mean in group female   mean in group male 
##                64543                73239</code></pre>
<p>The p-value is 2e-04, our null hypothesis is not 95% likely to be true, which implies that the salary difference between two gender is not noise.</p>
<p>We can also run a hypothesis testing with the simulation method from the <code>infer</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(116)

<pre class="r"><code># hypothesis testing using infer package</code></pre>
<p>From this plot we get a p-value of 0, which lead to the same conclusion of previous analyse: the null hypothesis is not likely to be true.</p>

<div id="relationship-experience---gender" class="section level2">
<h2>Relationship Experience - Gender</h2>
<p>At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   gender min    Q1 median   Q3 max  mean    sd  n missing
## 1 female   0  0.25    3.0 14.0  29  7.38  8.51 26       0
## 2   male   1 15.75   19.5 31.2  44 21.12 10.92 24       0</code></pre>
<p>Based on this evidence, we perform similar analyses as in the previous section. We can conclude that the average eperience year of male employees is higher than that of female employees.</p>
<p>For confidence intervals analyse, the CI data frame and CI plot are shown as below.</p>
<pre><code>##   gender  mean    SD sample_size t_critical   SE margin_of_error CI_upper
## 1 female  7.38  8.51          26       2.06 1.67            3.44     10.8
## 2   male 21.12 10.92          24       2.07 2.23            4.61     25.7
##   CI_lower
## 1     3.95
## 2    16.52</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blog/omega-gender_files/figure-html/CI_exp_plot-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
The hypothesis testing using <code>t.test()</code> also reports a p-value which is smaller than 0.05, which implies that the null hypothesis is not 95% likely to be true.</p>
<pre><code>## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  experience by gender
## t = -5, df = 43, p-value = 1e-05
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -19.35  -8.13
## sample estimates:
## mean in group female   mean in group male 
##                 7.38                21.12</code></pre>

<h2>Relationship Salary - Experience</h2>
<p>Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.</p>
<p>In order to analyse the relationship between salary and experience, we draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>salary_exp_scatter &lt;- ggplot(omega,aes(x=experience,y=salary))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title=&quot;Salary goes up when experience year increases&quot;,subtitle = &quot;Scatterplot between salary and experience&quot;,caption=&quot;Data from Omega Group Plc.&quot;)
salary_exp_scatter</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blog/omega-gender_files/figure-html/salary_exp_scatter-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
From this plot, we can see that when experience year increases, salary also follows an increasing trend. This can explain the significant difference between the salaries of men and women. As shown in part 2, men in Omega have higher average working years than women, so their mean salary is higher than that of female employees, which may lead to a misleading conclusion that women in this group are under discrimination.</p>
