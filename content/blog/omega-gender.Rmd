# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination


At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

The objective of this analysis is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data
In this part, we use read_csv function to load the data and then examine the data frame.
```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. In order to find out the relationship between salary and gender in this group, we perform four different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion.

- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing
-	Correlation analysis
-	Regression

For confidence intervals analyse, we create and print a dataframe where, for each gender,show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval below.
```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
summary_stat <- mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)
# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size,
CI_salary <- select(summary_stat,gender,mean,SD=sd,sample_size=n)%>%
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error,and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval 
  mutate(t_critical=qt(0.975,sample_size-1),
            SE=SD/sqrt(sample_size),
            margin_of_error=t_critical*SE,
            CI_upper=mean+margin_of_error,
            CI_lower=mean-margin_of_error)
CI_salary
```
```{r,CI_salary_plot,fig.height=5,fig.width=8}
CI_salary_plot <- ggplot(CI_salary,aes(x=gender,y=mean,color=gender))+
  geom_point(size=4)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=CI_lower,ymax=CI_upper),width=0.1,size=1)+
  labs(y="mean salary",x="",title="Do male and female in Omega Group Plc. have the same mean salary?",subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",caption="Data from Omega Group Plc.")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  coord_flip()

CI_salary_plot

```
There is no overlap between the 95% confidence intervals for the average salary of the two sexes, which implies that in this group, male's mean salary is higher than that of female.

Our teem also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. 

First, we run the hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and the code is shown as below.
```{r, hypothesis_testing}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary~gender,data=omega)
```
The p-value is 2e-04, our null hypothesis is not 95% likely to be true, which implies that the salary difference between two gender is not noise.

We can also run a hypothesis testing with the simulation method from the `infer` package.
```{r,salary_null_plot,fig.height=5,fig.width=8}
set.seed(116)
salary_in_null_world <-omega%>%
  specify(salary~gender)%>%
  hypothesise(null="independence")%>%
  generate(reps=1000,type="permute") %>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means",order=c("male","female"))

salary_null_plot <- ggplot(salary_in_null_world,aes(x=stat))+
  geom_histogram(bins=30)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 8696,colour="red",size=0.75)+
  labs(x="Average Male Salary - Average Female Salary",
       y="Count",
       title="Difference in Male and Female mean salary of Omega Group Plc.
in a world there's really no difference",
       subtitle = "Observed difference marked in red")+
  theme_bw()
salary_null_plot

salary_in_null_world%>%
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = 8696,direction = "both")
# hypothesis testing using infer package


```
From this plot we get a p-value of 0, which lead to the same conclusion of previous analyse: the null hypothesis is not likely to be true.

## Relationship Experience - Gender

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).
```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)
```
Based on this evidence, we perform similar analyses as in the previous section. We can conclude that the average eperience year of male employees is higher than that of female employees.

For confidence intervals analyse, the CI data frame and CI plot are shown as below.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
summary_stat_exp <- mosaic::favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)
# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size,
CI_exp <- select(summary_stat_exp,gender,mean,SD=sd,sample_size=n)%>%
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error,and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval 
  mutate(t_critical=qt(0.975,sample_size-1),
            SE=SD/sqrt(sample_size),
            margin_of_error=t_critical*SE,
            CI_upper=mean+margin_of_error,
            CI_lower=mean-margin_of_error)
CI_exp
```
```{r,CI_exp_plot,fig.height=5,fig.width=8,echo=FALSE}
CI_exp_plot <- ggplot(CI_exp,aes(x=gender,y=mean,color=gender))+
  geom_point(size=4)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=CI_lower,ymax=CI_upper),width=0.1,size=1)+
  labs(y="average working years",x="",title="Do male and female in Omega Group Plc. have the same average experience years?",subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",caption="Data from Omega Group Plc.")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  coord_flip()
CI_exp_plot

```
The hypothesis testing using `t.test()` also reports a p-value which is smaller than 0.05, which implies that the null hypothesis is not 95% likely to be true.
```{r, hypothesis_testing_exp,echo=FALSE}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience~gender,data=omega)
```
The p-value and null plot obtained by infer package method are shown as below. 
```{r,exp_null_plot,fig.height=5,fig.width=8}
set.seed(116)
exp_in_null_world <-omega%>%
  specify(experience~gender)%>%
  hypothesise(null="independence")%>%
  generate(reps=1000,type="permute") %>%
  calculate(stat="diff in means",order=c("male","female"))

exp_null_plot <- ggplot(exp_in_null_world,aes(x=stat))+
  geom_histogram(bins=30)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 13.74,colour="red",size=0.75)+
  labs(x="Average Male Working Years - Average Female Working Years",
       y="Count",
       title="Difference in Male and Female mean working years of Omega Group Plc.
in a world there's really no difference",
       subtitle = "Observed difference marked in red")+
  theme_bw()
exp_null_plot

exp_in_null_world%>%
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = 13.74,direction = "both")
# hypothesis testing using infer package


```
## Relationship Salary - Experience

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

In order to analyse the relationship between salary and experience, we draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data.
```{r, salary_exp_scatter,fig.height=5,fig.width=8}
salary_exp_scatter <- ggplot(omega,aes(x=experience,y=salary))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title="Salary goes up when experience year increases",subtitle = "Scatterplot between salary and experience",caption="Data from Omega Group Plc.")
salary_exp_scatter



```
From this plot, we can see that when experience year increases, salary also follows an increasing trend. This can explain the significant difference between the salaries of men and women. As shown in part 2, men in Omega have higher average working years than women, so their mean salary is higher than that of female employees, which may lead to a misleading conclusion that women in this group are under discrimination.

## Check correlations between the data
We use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. 

```{r, ggpairs,fig.height=5,fig.width=8,echo=FALSE}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  labs(title="Correlation matrix of Omega dataset",caption="Data from Omega Group Plc.")+
  theme_bw()
```
