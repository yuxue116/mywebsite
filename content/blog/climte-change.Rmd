  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed

First we download the data from data.giss.nasa.gov website.
```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}
weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")
```

```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>% select(Year,Jan,Feb,Mar,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec) %>% 
  gather("month","delta",2:12)
```

## Plotting Information
Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. 

```{r scatter_plot, eval=TRUE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=TRUE}

#Your code goes here...
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  ) + facet_wrap(~month)
```

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

```{r intervals, eval=TRUE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```


Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in.

```{r density_plot, eval=TRUE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. 

```{r averaging, eval=TRUE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y=annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         
```

## Confidence Interval for delta

A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

We have constructed a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=TRUE}
library("infer")

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>% 

  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
  # snippet taken from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35953394/calculating-length-of-95-ci-using-dplyr
  summarise(mean = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n()) %>%
  mutate(se = sd / sqrt(count),
         lower_ci = mean - qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), count - 1) * se,
         upper_ci = mean + qt(1 - (0.05 / 2), count - 1) * se)
  
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
formula_ci_infer <- comparison %>% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>% 

  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta)
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  specify(response=delta) %>% 
  generate(reps=100,type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat="mean")

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci_infer %>%  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95,type="percentile")

```

The 95% Confidence Interval values for the average annual temperature delta between years 2011-present is between 0.91C to 1.02C as compared to the base year. This is a worrying result as it represents a significant increase since 2011. Which as mentioned, could lead to major climate changes.
